Hospitium Status Cron
====

Simple ruby script that syncs pingdom with stashboard. Ran as a cron job on heroku. Used for [status.hospitium.co](http://status.hospitium.co).

Based on the awesome script from [http://dev.bizo.com/2011/05/synchronizing-stashboard-with-pingdom.html](http://dev.bizo.com/2011/05/synchronizing-stashboard-with-pingdom.html)
